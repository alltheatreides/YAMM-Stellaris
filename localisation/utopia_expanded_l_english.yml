 # UTOPIA EXPANDED EVENTS
 ue.1.name:0 "Dyson Ring Construction"
 ue.1.desc:0 "We are now ready to begin construction on the most ambitious megastructures project to date - a Dyson Ring around the primary star of the [From.From.GetName] system.\n\nUsing the Dyson Core around the system star to generate energy and still being able to sustain four Ringworld Habitats from the same star is nothing short of astounding. The amount of resources and materials required to build this skeletal frame will be immense, and hundreds of thousands of our finest engineers stand ready to begin the process of dismantling the system's planetary bodies into matter which can be used in its construction."
 ue.1.a:0 "Truly, we are the masters of the heavens."
 ue.3.name:0 "Dyson Ring Project"
 ue.3.desc.a:0 "Word has reached us that the [From.GetName] has undertaken a construction project of monumental proportions in the [dyson_ring_system.GetName] system. They intend to build a phenomenal Dyson Ring around the system's primary, and as a first step they have started to convert the matter of all nearby planetary bodies into an initial metal skeleton for the megastructure."
 ue.3.desc.b:0 "We have received intelligence that the [From.GetName] is about to start construction on yet another Dyson Ring, this time in the [dyson_ring_system.GetName] system! As before, their engineers are currently in the process of dismantling all planetary bodies in the system so that their resources and materials can be used in the Dyson Ring's construction."
 ue.3.a:0 "Will it be as impressive as our own?"
 ue.3.b:0 "An impressive project... if it is ever finished."
 ue.4.name:0 "Dyson Ring Skeletal Frame Completed"
 ue.4.desc:0 "The skeletal frame of the Ring World section of the mighty Dyson Ring we are building in the [From.From.GetName] system has finally been completed. Although there is still much left to do, the mere completion of this metal skeleton, which has a circumference of nearly a billion kilometers, must be considered an incredible feat of engineering.\n\nWe are now ready to start work on creating the actual habitats, and on constructing the Dyson Core."
 ue.4.a:0 "Much work lies before us."
 ue.5.name:0 "Dyson Ring Habitats Completed"
 ue.5.desc:0 "We have concluded work on the habitat sections of the Ring World section of the Dyson Ring we built in the [From.From.GetName] system. Our engineers and ecologists have accomplished the impossible.\n\nThe [Root.GetName] must now truly be considered one of the greatest builders in the history of the galaxy."
 ue.5.a:0 "This is a great day."
 ue.6.name:0 "Dyson Ring Core Panels Installed"
 ue.6.desc:0 "While not yet complete, with the installation of advanced solar harvesters we have begun to reap the benefits of the Core of the Dyson Ring being built in the [From.From.GetName] system.\n\nThe energy gains will only continue to increase as construction continues, eventually reaching full operational capacity when the Core is completed.""
 ue.6.a:0 "Excellent, let us continue."
 ue.7.name:0 "[From.From.GetName] Dyson Ring Core Completed"
 ue.7.desc:0 "The [From.From.GetName] system's primary has now been completely enveloped by a [Root.GetAdj] Dyson Ring Core.\n\nOur engineers celebrate this as a great victory, and rightly so. We have achieved what only a handful of star empires in the history of the galaxy dared imagine - the total subjugation and control of the energy output of a star."
 ue.7.a:0 "Energy output exceeds projections."
