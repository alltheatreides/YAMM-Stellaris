 pc_asteroid_m_desc:0 "A large metallic asteroid composed mainly of rock and metal."
 pc_molten:0 "Molten World"
 pc_molten_desc:0 "Rocky world that is scorching hot. The atmosphere is thin or non-existent, and lava from the interior flows freely due to constant volcanic eruptions. This type of planet cannot sustain organic life."
 pc_frozen:0 "Frozen World"
 pc_frozen_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface."

 pc_desert:0 "Desert World"
 pc_desert_desc:0 "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Precipitation and major bodies of surface water are relatively rare. Significant temperature variations between day and night cycles. Vegetation is scarce, but even moderate precipitation can make the desert bloom."
 pc_arid:0 "Arid World"

 pc_ocean:0 "Ocean World"

 pc_black_hole:0 "Black Hole"
 pc_black_hole_desc:0 "Typically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed."
 pc_neutron_star:0 "Neutron Star"
 pc_neutron_star_desc:0 "These incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star."
 pc_pulsar:0 "Pulsar"
 pc_pulsar_desc:0 "Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy."
 pc_infested:0 "Infested World"
 pc_infested_desc:0 "The surface of this world is covered by some kind of biological contaminant."
 pc_gaia:0 "Gaia World"
 pc_gaia_desc:0 "An ideal, temperate world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Optimal conditions for all known higher forms of life at different latitudes."
 pc_nuked:0 "Tomb World"
 pc_nuked_desc:0 "A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. It is currently experiencing a nuclear winter, with dense layers of sooty aerosols in the atmosphere. High levels of surface radiation. Minimal signs of life."
 pc_ringworld_habitable:0 "Ring World"
 pc_ringworld_habitable_desc:0 "An immense band encircling the system's sun.\nBuilt to allow for numerous artificial habitation zones along its inner span, freed from the restrictions and mundanity of planet-bound, spherical existence."

 pc_ringworld_tech_damaged:0 "Ring World"
 pc_ringworld_tech_damaged_desc:0 "An immense band encircling the system's sun.\n\nThis section of the superstructure appears irreparably damaged."
 pc_ringworld_seam_damaged:0 "Ring World"
 pc_ringworld_seam_damaged_desc:0 "An immense band encircling the system's sun.\n\nThis section of the superstructure appears irreparably damaged."
 pc_shielded:0 "Shielded World"
 pc_shielded_desc:0 "This entire world is encased in some kind of impenetrable energy barrier. It blocks all scans of the surface."
 pc_ai:0 "AI World"
 pc_ai_desc:0 "Rocky world covered with artificial structures. The thin atmosphere consists mostly of industrial pollutants. There are strong energy emissions coming from across the entire surface, but no organic life signs."
