 mem_lunar_gate.2.name:0 "The Lunar Gate"
 mem_lunar_gate.2.desc:0 "Prospectors on [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] have discovered a large vein of unique elements that may enable the construction of a long range wormhole generator on the moon itself! Unlike our standard wormholes, the proposed wormhole gate would connect [lunar_gate_planet.GetName] to every other colony in our space simultaneously! However, there are several issues: First, the wormholes created by the Lunar Gate will be completely incompatible with our standard ship designs. Only small civilian ships will be able to access and use the gate as the wormholes are much smaller and more unstable than currently understood wormhole technology. While inconvenient for our military and our own civilian ships, the gate should greatly boost the colony's economy by providing nearly instant contact with our other colonies. Second, the Lunar Gate will utilize a completely new wormhole theory and is thus untested. Our standard wormhole theory necessitates that wormholes only exist outside of the gravity well of a system. [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName]'s unique elements allow us to bypass this constraint but the risk of failure is substantial. Finally, the construction of the Lunar Gate is not without cost: it will take a substantial investment to build the Gate."
 mem_lunar_gate.2.a:0 "The benefits outweigh the risks."
 mem_lunar_gate.2.b:0 "Too much can go wrong. Study the elements instead."
 mem_lunar_gate.2.c:0 "It's too expensive. Study the elements instead."
 mem_lunar_gate.2.d:0 "We can't afford it yet. Begin amassing needed resources."
 
 mem_lunar_gate.3.name:0 "Final Chance to Construct Lunar Gate"
 mem_lunar_gate.3.desc:0 "Local interests from [lunar_gate_planet.GetName] are demanding that we make a decision regarding the proposed Lunar Gate. It seems that the local government is losing its appetite for such an expensive and risky project. If construction for the Lunar Gate is to begin, it needs to begin now. However, if we did not sufficiently save for the Gate, the colony will have less faith in our government overall."
 mem_lunar_gate.3.a:0 "The benefits outweigh the risks."
 mem_lunar_gate.3.b:0 "Too much can go wrong. Study the elements instead."
 mem_lunar_gate.3.c:0 "It's still too expensive. Study the elements instead."
 
 MEM_LUNAR_GATE_PROJECT:0 "Construct Lunar Gate"
 MEM_LUNAR_GATE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The construction of the Lunar Gate on [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] will require one of our best scientists to pioneer the new miniature wormhole technology needed. With the construction of the Lunar Gate, the economy of [lunar_gate_planet.GetName] will be revolutionized with quick civilian access to all of our colonized space."
 
 mem_lunar_gate.4.name:0 "Lunar Gate Completed"
 mem_lunar_gate.4.desc:0 "The Lunar Gate on [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] has been successfully activated and is revolutionizing [lunar_gate_planet.GetName]! With transportation times to our other worlds cut nearly to zero, the economy is growing and an unprecedented rate. While we will need to monitor the Gate and [lunar_gate_planet.GetName] to ensure there are no negative effects, it's safe to say that the Lunar Gate project has been a success."
 
 mem_lunar_gate.5.name:0 "Lunar Gate Disaster"
 mem_lunar_gate.5.desc:0 "An accident on [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] has resulted in disaster for the Lunar Gate! When testing the gate, a gravitational anomaly caused a massive wormhole that ripped the planet apart. Needless to say, the Lunar Gate was lost along with the entirety of [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName]. Massive fragments of the former moon are raining down on [lunar_gate_planet.GetName] and have already destroyed several regions and their populations. Additionally, the debris from [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] is interfering with the environment of [planet_name] and is causing health problems across the world. It will be quite some time before the colony recovers."
 mem_lunar_gate.5.a:0 "What a tragedy!"
 
 mem_lunar_gate.6.name:0 "Lunar Gate Collapse"
 mem_lunar_gate.6.desc:0 "An accident on [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName] has resulted in disaster for the Lunar Gate! When testing the gate, a wormhole collapsed and created a micro-black hole which consumed [mem_lunar_gate_moon.GetName]! Unfortunately, [This.GetLeaderName] was within the event horizon when black hole emerged along with the rest of the crew of [This.GetName]. Thankfully, the orbit of new black hole is stable around [lunar_gate_planet.GetName] and does not appear to be interfering with [lunar_gate_planet.GetName]. Our current projections do not have the black hole evaporating in this millennium so for now, the colony is safe. If nothing else, at least the new black hole will provide an interesting object of study."
 
 mem_lunar_gate_broken_promise:0 "Broken promise"
 mem_lunar_gate_broken_promise_desc:0 "The talks about building a Lunar Gate amounted to nothing."
 
 mem_lunar_gate_completed:0 "Lunar Gate"
 mem_lunar_gate_completed_desc:0 "The Lunar Gate provides long-range wormhole access to civilian ships of the system."
 
 mem_lunar_gate_access:0 "Access to Lunar Gate"
 mem_lunar_gate_access_desc:0 "Near instant access to all colonized worlds has boosted the local economy."
 
 mem_lunar_gate_catastrophe:0 "Lunar Gate Catastrophe"
 mem_lunar_gate_catastrophe_desc:0 "The failed Lunar Gate destroyed the moon."
 
 mem_lunar_gate_pollution:0 "Lunar Gate Disaster"
 mem_lunar_gate_pollution_desc:0 "The debris from the moon and the failed Lunar Gate has polluted the environment of the world."
 
 mem_lunar_gate_former_moon:0 "Former Moon"
 mem_lunar_gate_former_moon_desc:0 "The Lunar Gate experiment ended with the moon being consumed into a black hole."
