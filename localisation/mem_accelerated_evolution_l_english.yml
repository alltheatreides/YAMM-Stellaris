 mem_accelerated_evolution.1.desc:0 "After several months of living on §Y[Root.GetName]§, the colonists noticed something odd about the surrounding environment. Species seemed to drastically change from one month to the next. On the order of the colony's administration a quick study was performed which showed incredibly fast evolutionary processes from the planet's flora and fauna. It appears that sexual and asexual reproduction, along with a shorter than average life cycle, seem to be traits that all species on this world have.\n\nOn one hand, repeatedly adapting to the local biosphere prevents the colonists from ever truly fitting in — nothing with an ordinary evolutionary cycle could. On the other, constant evolution and rapid breeding from the local animals leads to advancements in farming and evolutionary science. Either way, the biosphere of a planet is too complicated to change on this sort of scale. The colonists are saddled with this for good or ill."
