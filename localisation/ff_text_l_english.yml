silicate_microbes_category_desc:0 "A lake on the surface seems to be contaminated with a substance from a nearby mine which ship scanners cannot identify  It may be worth exploring."
ff_anomaly.1.name:0 "Silicate Goo!"
ff_anomaly.1.desc:0 "The crew of the [Root.GetName] have brought back a  sample from a mine on the surface of {From.GetName] and we are ecstatic to share great news.  What they first thought was mineral water has a strange jello like consistency similar to hydrated silica gel. We have not found anything conclusive, but our preliminary investigation has revealed that it is filled with particulates that may have unusual organic properties.  We suspect they may even be alive!  We feel that the mines warrent an investigation.  "
ff_anomaly.1.a:0 "We will send someone at the first opportunity."

ff_anomaly.2.desc:0 "The crew of the [Root.GetName] have reported that while they were collecting jewel encrusted samples on {From.GetName], some of them disappeared without any warning.  All members of the team were searched as well as the mine.  There disappearance seems to confirm that they have some value.  We think there should be an investigation."
ff_anomaly.2.a:0 "Let's find out who took them."

ff_anomaly.1001.desc:0 "After an extensive study of the goo from [From.GetName]'s caves, [Root.GetLeaderName] has determined that the particulates are indeed a new form of microbial life.  This new form of life uses both silicon and carbon as a base for organic molecules.  Often, interchangeably and that ability has been determined to be very useful in ship upkeep.\n\nIn addition, we have been able to determine the conditions under which this form of life thrives.  Now that we know what to look for, we should be able to find it whereever it may be.  "

ff_anomaly.1002.desc:0 "It took several days of searching the caves and the surrounding area but the crew of the [Root.GetName] have found the missing rocks.  Finding them was even more confusing since we could not find any evidence that someone had taken them.\n\nAfter taking them back to the ship, [Root.GetLeaderName] witnessed one of them move of its own accord.  We have discovered that they are alive and mobile!  They appear to feed on jewels with a high carbon content.  Coal works as well but they diamonds seem to be their favorite meal.  Their behavior seems docile and are very friendly toward other life forms.  Except for their diet, they appear to make great pets... they should be a big hit among the rich and famous!   We think we also know how to look for more of them!"
ff_anomaly.1002.a:0 "Pet Rocks? Anyone named Gary or Robin would love to hear about this."
ff_anomaly.1002.a.tooltip:0 "Grants your empire the $tech_ff_silicate_genome|G$ technology."
ff_anomaly.1003.name:0 ""I lose more jewels that way!""
ff_anomaly.1003.desc:0 "The rocks that were dsicovered by a [FromFromFrom.GetName] are indeed alive! During the investigation, one of the rocks ate a diamond from [Root.GetLeaderName]'s prize rock collection!.  The team aboard the [Root.GetName] have discovered that they creatures of a brand new kingdom.\n\nThey appear to feed on jewels with a high carbon content (which is why it ate the diamond).  Coal works as well but they diamonds seem to be their favorite meal.  Otherwise, their behavior seems docile and are very friendly toward other life forms.
