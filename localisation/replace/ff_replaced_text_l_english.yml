###  Replaced Text For Stars

pc_b_star:0 "Blue Giant Sun"
pc_b_star_desc:0 "The blue giant is a very rare star that on average is eighteen times more massive than the sun and only lives an average of 55 million years.  Both B and O class stars never form mature planets because of their short lived life spans."
pc_a_star:0 "White Sun"
pc_a_star_desc:0 "The white star is neither a dwarf nor a giant.  At an average of four time the mass of our sun, many live long enough to form mature planets but not long enough to naturally host life.  Their average life-span is 400 million years."
pc_f_star:0 "Yellow-white Dwarf Sun"
pc_f_star_desc:0 "The yellow white star is small enough to be considered a dwarf.  At only 1.8 times our sun's mass (on average) they have a wide enough habitable zone to host life on multiple planets if conditions are right and they live long enough.  On average they live about 5 billion years."
pc_g_star:0 "Yellow Dwarf Sun"
pc_g_star_desc:0 "The yellow dwarf is the prime location to find habitable planets.  They always live long enough for life to reach complexities that aren't usually found on more massive stars and they have a habitable zone that is a fair distance away from the star itself."
pc_k_star:0 "Orange Dwarf Sun"
pc_k_star_desc:0 "The orange dwarf lives pleny long enough for life to reach very complex forms.  The problem is that with lower mass orange dwarf stars, the planets muct be too close to the sun for life to form as tidal locking prevents the conditions best for hosting complex life forms."
pc_m_star:0 "Red Dwarf Sun"
pc_m_star_desc:0 "The red dwarf is by far the most plentiful visible star type in existence.  They are also traditionally mineral poor, with habitable zones too narrow and too close to the star to have high chances of complex life forms except as a  moon to a gas giant."
sc_b:0 "§HBlue Giant (B class)§!"
sc_b_desc:0 "§LThe large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them some of the most visible to the naked eye.§!"
sc_a:0 "§HWhite Sub-Giant (A class)§!"
sc_a_desc:0 "§LThese relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants.§!"
sc_f:0 "§HYellow-White Sub-Dwarf (F class)§!"
sc_f_desc:0 "§LF-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarves. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds.§!"
sc_g:0 "§HYellow Dwarf (G class)§!"
sc_g_desc:0 "§LOften referred to as yellow dwarves, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life.§!"
sc_k:0 "§HOrange Dwarf (K class)§!"
sc_k_desc:0 "§LThese main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarves, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life.§!"
sc_m:0 "§HRed Dwarf (M class)§!"
sc_m_desc:0 "§LThe most common stars in the universe, often referred to as red dwarves. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarves emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life.§!"

###  Replaced Text For Planets

pc_asteroid:0 "Asteroid"
pc_asteroid_desc:0 "A large asteroid with a mixed composition: silicates, metals, carbon, and carbides."
pc_ocean:0 "Archipelago (Ocean)"
pc_barren:0 "Barren"
pc_barren_cold:0 "Cold Barren"
pc_savannah_desc:0 "A warm, wet-dry continental world, dominated by deserts, large grasslands, and tropical coasts, covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The hydrosphere allows for wet seasons that vary in length depending on tilt; but aside from the ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated on coastal regions."
pc_alpine:0 "Boreal World"
pc_alpine_desc:0 "A cold, continental world vast continental glaciers, boreal forests, and a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Glaciers cover the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys.  The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the equatorial bands can be somewhat temperate and when tilted, these regions can host vast desiduous forests."
pc_arctic_desc:0 "A frigid, and moist archipelago world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.  Polar oceans are largely frozen, while the string islands are largely glaciated.  Equatorial oceans are less frigid, more moist,  and the islands are covered in rich, tiaga forests."

story.405.desc.spiri:0 "Literally clouds from the void, the Void Clouds are invaders of our cosmos. They drift, self aware, and fully conscious agglomerations of inanimate and dark matter from a dying universe.  Once [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] astronomers knew what to look for, they found traces of the Void Clouds everywhere.\n\nDuring the earliest years of time itself, they crossed through the void into our universe as theirs came to an end.  Crossing through the supermassive singularity at the end of their own universe and into ours at the dawn of creation, they were trapped in time as the first stars were lit and young planets formed; until their own universe’s final singularity came to an end.  Set free to roam the stars, they are now a constant reminder that life can thrive in even the most bizarre conditions"
story.405.desc:0 "Given their origin, the Void Clouds are likely the oldest sentient entities in the universe. They seem to have originated in the only place they could in a universe that was growing cold with age: around black holes.  As such this is where they are at home, building void giants which they use as nests to breed.\n\n.While their capacity for intelligence survived the transition, it is not entirely clear how even animal intelligence would have been able to traverse the void.  One theory is that didn’t; that whatever they use for genetic coding simply allowed their intelligence in our universe to re-evolve very quickly.\n\nThe root of their intelligence might lie in the abnormally strong electromagnetic fields that keep them together – Given the strange conditions under which they evolved, it is not inconceivable that, given enough time, the circulation of its strange stardust and gravitic fields aligned in a flexible approximation of neural pathways.\n\nWhat is clear is that the Clouds are receiving impulses from one another from lightyears apart. Quantum entanglement is suspected to play a role in this phenomenon.  They seem to be united in a purpose.  As far as [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] researchers can tell, they appear to be working to transform our own universe into the conditions that existed in their own by speeding up its evolution and ridding it of regular life."
